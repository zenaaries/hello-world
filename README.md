# hello-world
yes, another repository!
I did my first two crude video games programmed in C++ when I when 13 years old and fell in love with computer science.  Unfortunately, my dad deleted my copy of C++ :-(  and my favorite computer teacher left me.  For years, I was forsaken but I persevere!
The great news, is that my dream of coding has never died and today I am to finally get access to this secert world again for FREE!
